## MyNinja.co

Using [ParticleJS](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) and some CSS trickery, this is version 2.0 of [MyNinja.co](http://www.myninja.co).

To use, after downloading or cloning the repo, I would use something like [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)- you can install it using `npm install -g live-server`. You can omit the `-g` if you don't want it installed globally for use.

After that, from the folder's root directory, just run `live-server` in the command prompt.
